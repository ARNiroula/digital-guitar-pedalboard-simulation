# digital-guitar-pedalboard-simulation
Digital Guitar Pedalboard Simulation. 

A barebone simulation of Digital Pedalboard. The raw input comes from either:
- Guitar input through an audio interface
- Synthetic string input using karplus-strong string synthesis

## Goals
The input will then be sent through a chain of different types of popular audio effects such as deplay, flanger, modulation, etc. 
Visualization of input/output will also be available
